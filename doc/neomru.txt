SOURCES						*neomru-sources*

						*unite-source-file_mru*
file_mru	Nominates files you used recently as candidates, ordering
		by time series.

		For file_mru and directory_mru source, two lists are
		maintained

		1. short list for quick start; |g:unite_source_file_mru_limit|
		2. long list for tracking mru history.
		|g:unite_source_file_mru_long_limit|

		Normally, only the short list are shown in the unite window.
		To load the long list  Hit the key associated with
		|<Plug>(unite_redraw)| to trigger the unite redraw event.

		Or, you can start file_mru/directory_mru with argument
		including `*`, `_`, or `all`, `long`

		For example, `Unite file_mru:long`

		The mru code is overhauled to tracking long mru history.
		Set a large number like 5000 for the long limit will not
		impact vim performance.

						*unite-source-directory_mru*
directory_mru	Nominates directories you used recently as candidates,
		ordering by time series.

		Refer to |unite-source-file_mru|

FAQ						*neomru-faq*

Q: mru source is slow in large mru files.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/422

A: You can set |g:unite_source_mru_do_validate| to 0. It is faster. But unite
does not validate mru files.

Q: I want to restrict the files I see to the current project or the current
directory in mru sources.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/456

A: You should use |unite-filter-matcher_project_files|. >
  call unite#custom#source(
        \ 'file_mru', 'matchers',
        \ ['matcher_project_files', 'matcher_fuzzy'])
